# MarketHub Complete Delivery System - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This implementation provides a complete delivery system integrating **WooCommerce role management**, **automated sign-up workflows**, and a **unified driver app** with Google Maps routing and proof of delivery.

## üì¶ Files Created

1. **markethub-role-management.php** - Part 1: Role management, sign-up, and employee approval
2. **markethub-unified-driver-app.php** - Part 2: Complete driver app with maps and POD
3. **MarketHub Delivery system complete2.txt** - Existing delivery calculation system (provided by user)

---

## üöÄ Part 1: Role Management & Sign-up System

### Features Implemented

#### ‚úÖ Action 1 & 2: Role Standardization & Pending Role
- **Roles Created:**
  - `markethub_drivers` (plural) - Active drivers
  - `markethub_employees` (plural) - Active employees
  - `markethub_pending` - Temporary holding role
- **Old Role Removed:** `markethub_driver` (singular)

#### ‚úÖ Action 3: Unified Sign-up Logic
- **Registration Form Enhancement:**
  - Added applicant type selector (Driver/Employee/Customer)
  - Visual styling with color-coded options
  - Automatic role assignment to `markethub_pending` for drivers/employees
  - Regular customers get standard `customer` role
- **User Meta Stored:**
  - `mh_applicant_type` - Type of applicant
  - `mh_pending_reason` - Reason for pending status

#### ‚úÖ Action 4: Automate Driver Activation
- **First Login Hook:**
  - Detects drivers with `markethub_pending` role
  - Automatically upgrades to `markethub_drivers` on first login
  - Sends welcome email with driver app link
  - Logs activation time and method

#### ‚úÖ Action 5: Restrict Pending Access
- **Dashboard Block:** Pending users redirected from wp-admin
- **API Block:** REST API returns 403 for pending users
- **Login Redirect:** Pending users logged out with explanatory message
- **Driver App Block:** Login endpoint checks role and blocks pending users

#### ‚úÖ Action 6: Employee Migration & Login
- **Migration Tool:**
  - Admin page at Tools ‚Üí MH Employee Migration
  - Migrates from `wp_mh_employees` custom table to WordPress users
  - Preserves passwords and data
  - Safe to run multiple times
- **Updated Authentication:**
  - Employee login now uses WordPress `wp_authenticate()`
  - Checks for `markethub_employees` role
  - Generates secure tokens with 24-hour expiry

#### ‚úÖ Action 7: Admin Confirmation Panel
- **Management Dashboard:**
  - Location: WordPress Admin ‚Üí MarketHub Mgmt
  - Shows pending employee applications
  - One-click approve/reject buttons
  - Statistics dashboard (pending/active counts)
  - Lists active employees and drivers
- **Email Notifications:**
  - Admin notified on new employee application
  - Employee notified on approval with login link

### Installation Instructions - Part 1

1. **Install the Plugin:**
   ```bash
   # Upload markethub-role-management.php to wp-content/plugins/
   # Activate via WordPress Admin ‚Üí Plugins
   ```

$order->get_meta('_markethub_customer_lat');
$order->get_meta('_markethub_customer_lng');
```

```php
// Grocery stores
$order->get_meta('_markethub_grocery_store');
$stores = get_option('markethub_grocery_stores');

// Food stores
$order->get_meta('_markethub_food_store');
$stores = get_option('markethub_food_stores');
